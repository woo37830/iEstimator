In the Default Estimation Model, the metrics such as number of inputs, queries, etc. are set to estimates during the functional specifications.  If you are confident of your estimates then select that as the estimation Ability, also set your teams ability and other parameters.  Select the predominant language of the application or divide the application into several sub-projects.  The duration and its standard deviation based upon several thousand commercial projects with similar characteristics are provided.  Based upon the parameters, the number of person months, team size, and estimated costs are similarily provided.\nLater versions will add milestone predictions, risk alert graphics, and the ability to investigate changes in the team size taking schedule incompressibility into account.";
